The ancient Greeks and Romans used iris in the form of essential oil; today, this cult fragrant note - obtained from the resin of a plant that blooms in May in Tuscany - is more valuable than gold. Another new note, Damascus rose, is a well-known type of rose that is picked in the early morning hours to get its most intense essence. Instead of the classic pyramidal construction composed of top, middle and bottom notes, Gucci Bloom notes open at once in full force, with notes of noble and rare flowers: jasmine bud extract, tuberose, rangun creeper, Damask rose and velvety outline."

Playing with the freshness of ginger, originally an African spice with a striking and energetic scent, the fruity and sparkling tonalities of the scent are enhanced by the accord of kumquat and top notes of mandarin and pink pepper. A balanced combination of lavender, geranium and rosemary merges in the heart of the fragrance, giving it an aromatic touch. Sophisticated patchouli and benzoin infuse sensual power and longevity, while vetiver is the central intoxicating note in this modern masculine creation."
